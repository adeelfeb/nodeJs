The terms **URL**, **URI**, and related concepts like **URN** are commonly used in web development, and understanding their differences is essential for working with web technologies. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**

A **URL** is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource on the web. It includes the protocol to be used and the resource's location.

#### **Components of a URL:**
```
https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?query=123#section
```

| **Component**        | **Example**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Protocol (Scheme)** | `https`                | Defines how to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).                    |
| **Host**              | `www.example.com`      | Specifies the domain or IP address.                                            |
| **Port**              | `8080`                 | (Optional) Specifies the port number used for the connection.                  |
| **Path**              | `/path/to/resource`    | Specifies the specific resource's location on the server.                      |
| **Query String**      | `?query=123`           | (Optional) Contains key-value pairs for additional parameters.                 |
| **Fragment**          | `#section`             | (Optional) Specifies a part of the resource (e.g., a specific section in a page). |

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- Always includes a **protocol** (like `http://` or `ftp://`).
- Used to locate resources on the internet.
- Example: `https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs`

### **2. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**

A **URI** is a broader term that identifies a resource, either by location (URL) or by name (URN), or both.

#### **Two Types of URIs**:
1. **URL (Locator)**:
   - Includes the location of the resource.
   - Example: `https://www.example.com`.

2. **URN (Name)**:
   - Refers to a resource by name without specifying its location.
   - Example: `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0` (used in libraries for books).

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.
- URIs can identify resources without describing their access method.

---

### **3. URN (Uniform Resource Name)**

A **URN** is a type of URI that uniquely identifies a resource by name, independent of its location.

#### **Example**:
- `urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2`

#### **Key Characteristics**:
- Does not specify how to locate the resource.
- Used in namespaces or registries (e.g., ISBNs for books).

| **Includes Protocol** | Yes (e.g., `http`, `ftp`)       | Optional                        | No                               |
| **Includes Location** | Yes                             | Optional                        | No                               |
| **Example**           | `https://example.com/file.html` | `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0`     | `urn:isbn:978-3-16-148410-0`     |

### **Other Related Terms**

#### 1. **IP Address**:
   - Numeric label assigned to devices on a network.
   - Example: `192.168.1.1`.

#### 2. **Domain Name**:
   - Human-readable name that maps to an IP address.
   - Example: `www.example.com`.

#### 3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
   - Translates domain names into IP addresses.
   - Example: When you enter `google.com`, DNS resolves it to an IP like `172.217.14.206`.

### **Summary**

- **URI**: A general identifier for resources.
- **URL**: A specific type of URI that includes a resource's location.
- **URN**: A type of URI that names a resource without specifying its location.

In day-to-day web development, you'll mostly work with **URLs**, but understanding the broader concept of **URIs** can help you in designing and consuming APIs or working with namespaces.





Yes, there are differences between the HTTP methods (PUT, POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE) in terms of **intended use**, **semantics**, and sometimes **performance implications**. However, the actual "weight" or overhead of the request doesn't vary significantly based on the HTTP method itself. Instead, the payload size, headers, and network factors contribute more to the request's "weight."

Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Key Differences Between HTTP Methods**
| Method  | Use Case                                                                 | Behavior & Semantics                                                                                         |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GET** | Retrieve data from the server                                            | Safe and idempotent. Should not have side effects on the server. Response contains data; no request body.    |
| **POST**| Submit data to create a new resource                                     | Non-idempotent. Typically used for actions that create new resources or trigger a process on the server.     |
| **PUT** | Replace an entire resource with the provided data                       | Idempotent. Multiple identical requests produce the same result.                                             |
| **PATCH**| Partially update an existing resource                                   | Not idempotent. Typically used for modifying only specific fields of a resource.                             |
| **DELETE**| Remove a resource from the server                                      | Idempotent. Multiple identical requests have the same effect.                                                |

---

### **2. Does PATCH Take Less Weight Compared to PUT or POST?**
- **Request Size**: 
  - PATCH usually requires a smaller payload compared to PUT because PATCH sends only the fields to update, while PUT requires the entire resource to be sent.
  - Example:
    - **PATCH** payload: `{ "name": "newName" }`
    - **PUT** payload: `{ "id": 1, "name": "newName", "email": "example@test.com" }`

- **Overhead**:
  - The overhead of using PATCH instead of PUT or POST is minimal. The main difference lies in the payload size, which affects the total request size and processing time.

---

### **3. Why Use the Appropriate Method?**
Even if "getting the job done" is your primary concern, sticking to the correct HTTP method is beneficial for several reasons:

- **Semantics**:
  - Following RESTful conventions makes your API more predictable, easier to use, and aligned with web standards.

- **Caching**:
  - GET requests can be cached by browsers and proxies, but POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are generally not cached.

- **Idempotence**:
  - Methods like PUT and DELETE are idempotent, meaning the same request can be repeated without additional side effects. POST is non-idempotent.

- **Standards and Interoperability**:
  - Using the correct HTTP method ensures your API works well with tools and services that rely on these standards, such as browsers, proxies, and API clients.

---

### **4. When to Use Each Method?**
- **GET**: Fetch data without modifying anything.
- **POST**: Create a new resource or trigger an action that doesn't fit other methods.
- **PUT**: Update or replace an entire resource.
- **PATCH**: Update only specific fields of a resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

---

### **5. Summary of Weight/Performance**
- **PATCH** may have a smaller request size compared to PUT or POST for updates because it only sends the changed fields.
- The HTTP method itself (e.g., PATCH vs. PUT) doesn’t significantly impact performance, as the network and server processing time are more dependent on the payload and how the server handles the request.

If you are looking for efficiency:
- Use **PATCH** for partial updates.
- Keep payloads and headers as small as possible.
- Optimize server-side processing for different methods. 

Following the correct HTTP method ensures better maintainability and scalability of your application.
